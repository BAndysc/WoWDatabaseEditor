# WoW Database Editor
Integrated development environment (IDE) for Smart Scripts and database editing for TrinityCore based servers.

This project is a continuation of [Visual SAI Studio](https://github.com/BandyscLegacy/VisualSAIStudio), but rewritten from scratch. Anyone is welcome to help :-) Together we can make great wow emu editor! **Smart script and database editing is already in good enough shape to use it on daily basis**

# I want to contribute!
That's a fantastic news! There is still a lot to do in the IDE, if you do not know what you can do, check out [opened issues, especially those marked as "help wanted"](https://github.com/BAndysc/WoWDatabaseEditor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

# How to build

**In order to build WoW Database Editor you need to install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)** (it is installed automatically with Visual Studio 2022)

**If you want to use Visual Studio, you need Visual Studio 2022**. That's because older Visual Studio version **doesn't** support .NET 6.0!

WoW Database Editor is using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), therefore after you clone, after you pull you have to download submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now you can open the solution in Visual Studio or other C#/.NET IDE and build. Start **LoaderAvalonia** project (this part is important!)

**To build a version to distribute:**

```
-- Windows version
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false -f net8.0 -o bin/wowdatabaseeditor-avalonia-win/ LoaderAvalonia/LoaderAvalonia.csproj -r win7-x64

-- MacOS version
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false -f net8.0 -o bin/wowdatabaseeditor-avalonia-mac/ LoaderAvalonia/LoaderAvalonia.csproj -r osx-x64

-- Linux version
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false -f net8.0 -o bin/wowdatabaseeditor-avalonia-linux/ LoaderAvalonia/LoaderAvalonia.csproj -r linux-x64
```
