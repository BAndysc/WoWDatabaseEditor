# WoW Database Editor
Integrated development environment (IDE) for Smart Scripts for TrinityCore based servers.

This project is continuation of [Visual SAI Studio](https://github.com/BandyscLegacy/VisualSAIStudio), but rewritten from scratch. It is still in early stages, but anyone is welcome to help :-) Together we can make great wow emu editor! **Smart script editing is already in good enough shape to use it on daily basis** 

# Supported server versions

 * Supported database: TC 3.3.5, TC 4.3.4 ("preservation project"), TC master (9.0.x), AzerothCore (3.3.5)
 * Supported DBC: 3.3.5, 4.3.4

# Download latest version

## Windows only version
**On Windows the application requires [.NET 5 Desktop Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)**. Ensure you have `.NET Desktop Runtime 5.x` installed (`.NET 5` is NOT enough)

Every commit is built by AppVeyor, here are the latest **Windows only binaries**: [WoWDatabaseEditorWindows.zip](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/BAndysc/wowdatabaseeditor/artifacts/WoWDatabaseEditor.zip?branch=master)

## Mac OS / Linux / Windows version
**To run the cross platform version, you need [.NET 5 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) for your OS**.

WoW Database Editor is also shipped with experimental cross platform version. That version is compatibile with both MacOS, Linux and Windows (this Windows version IS different to version above).
